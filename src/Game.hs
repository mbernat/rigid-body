Physics looks as follows:

1. step velocities according to forces:
  * ambient (gravity/drag)
  * point-based (move/jump)
  * collision-based
  * epsilon cut-off
2. step positions according to new velocities
   thanks to the collision detection, this should be simple integration

Even better approach:

0. detect collisions from state
1. setup all forces (ambient, input-based, collision-based)
2. integrate velocities from forces
3. integrate positions from velocities
4. detect collisions & goto 1

This means that collisions would become part of state
...which is nice because they can be derived from it directly.
E.g. when two objects are in contact then the collision information
is just a simple calculation based on their positions and velocities.

-- TODO timesteps
-- This is also necessary to handle collisions properly using bisection
-- to find the exact time of the first collision.
